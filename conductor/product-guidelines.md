# Product Guidelines - VogonPoet

## Prose Style & Tone
- **Friendly & Guiding:** Communications and documentation should be approachable and helpful. While the tool is built for power users, the language used should lower the barrier to entry and clearly guide the user through its minimalist interface.

## Brand Messaging
- **Privacy by Design:** Consistently reinforce that VogonPoet is a local frontend for a local backend. No audio or text leaves the user's machine.
- **Speed is a Feature:** Emphasize the ultra-low latency of the system. The UI should be marketed and perceived as "instant," matching the high-performance parakeet-stream backend.

## Visual Identity
- **Material Design 3 (Dark Mode Primary):** Adhere to the Material Design 3 specification, prioritizing a well-crafted Dark Mode. This reduces eye strain and helps the UI feel less intrusive when used as a persistent overlay.
- **Meaningful Color:** Use the MD3 color palette to provide functional feedback. State changes (e.g., active listening vs. idle) should be represented by subtle but clear shifts in the primary or accent color tokens.

## User Experience Principles
- **Minimalist Presence:** Every UI element must justify its existence. If it doesn't help the user understand the state or control the backend, it should be removed.
- **Feedback Loops:** Always provide immediate, friendly visual confirmation for user actions and backend events.
