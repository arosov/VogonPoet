# Product Guidelines - VogonPoet

## Prose Style & Tone
- **Friendly & Guiding:** Communications and documentation should be approachable and helpful. While the tool is built for power users, the language used should lower the barrier to entry and clearly guide the user through its minimalist interface.

## Brand Messaging
- **Privacy by Design:** Consistently reinforce that VogonPoet is a local frontend for a local backend. No audio or text leaves the user's machine.
- **Speed is a Feature:** Emphasize the ultra-low latency of the system. The UI should be marketed and perceived as "instant," matching the high-performance parakeet-stream backend.

## Visual Identity
- **Gruvbox Dark Aesthetic:** Adhere to the Gruvbox color palette, prioritizing the "Dark" variant for a high-contrast yet easy-on-the-eyes "retro-technical" look.
- **Meaningful Color (Gruvbox):**
    - **Green (#98971a / #b8bb26):** Active Listening / Connected.
    - **Red (#cc241d / #fb4934):** Errors / Disconnected.
    - **Blue (#458588 / #83a598):** Processing / Connecting.
    - **Background (#282828):** Main surface color.
    - **Foreground (#ebdbb2):** Primary text color.

## User Experience Principles
- **Minimalist Presence:** Every UI element must justify its existence. If it doesn't help the user understand the state or control the backend, it should be removed.
- **Feedback Loops:** Always provide immediate, friendly visual confirmation for user actions and backend events.
